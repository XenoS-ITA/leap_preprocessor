<h1 align="center">Leap V3</h1>

# This version is still in development!

`Leap` (**L**ua **e**xtension **a**ccessibility **p**re-processor) is a fast pre-processor of a "modernized" and extended version of lua that pre-processes in pure executable lua.  
Think of it as an effective "modernity" leap into the future to make lua a feature-rich language.
